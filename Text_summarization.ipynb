      "This paper analyzes the time-consuming analysis of each network module (PNet module, RNet module and ONet module) in MTCNN. It finds that the time-consuming of PNet module is the highest (about 70%) Two improved methods are proposed, one is to reduce the number of candidate face frames in input PNet network and the other is to reduce the number of output face frames in PNet network. It is verified in the FDDB face test set and practical application, the detection speed has increased by 70.1% when the detection rate has dropped by only 3.5%, and the improved scheme has achieved good results. This paper combines the channel bayonet application scenarios, through research and improve face detection algorithms, face tracking auxiliary algorithms, and introduce face selection algorithms in the face recognition module to satisfy the real-time and convenience requirements of the channel bayonet face recognition system. The improved face detection algorithm can be mounted on low-end devices with poor computing performance, and to improve the operating speed of the face recognition system through the improved face detection algorithm, it can be applied to channel bayonet face recognition system with low computing power, and to improve the operating speed of the face recognition system through the improved face detection algorithm, it can be mounted on low-end devices with poor computing performance, and to improve the operating speed of the face recognition system through the improved face detection algorithm, it can be applied to channel bayonet face recognition system with low computing power, and to improve the operating In view of the low detection speed of the MTCNN algorithm in high-resolution videos, a series of optimizations such as minnisize adjustment and PNet threshold adjustment are performed. According to the detection rate on the FDDB face test set and the actual detection speed in 720p high-resolution video, it can be seen that the detection speed increases by 70.1% when the detection rate drops by 3.5%. The face detection module was designed and implemented, and actual engineering tests were carried out.\n"
